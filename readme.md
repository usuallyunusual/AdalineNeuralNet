#AdalineNeuralNets 
This is a pure numpy implementation of an Adaline neural net.
Useful to understand how exactly these nets work and how they evolved. 
Check BackPropNetMSE for a more recent backpropogation implementation of a neural net which is also in pure numpy
Both stochastic and batch gradient update have been recorded
